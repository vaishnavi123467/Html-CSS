            This focuses on the user interface and the client-side of a website, including what users see and interact with in their browsers (e.g., buttons, forms, layouts). Key languages include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. </p>
        <p id="imp1">Back-end development:
            This handles the server-side logic, data processing, and database management of a website. It's the "behind the scenes" work that makes the website function, including user authentication, data storage, and API integration. </p>
